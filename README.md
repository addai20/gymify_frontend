I EMULATED THE FOLLOWING STRUCTURE FROM THE BUBBLE TEA ASSIGNMENT

**One important point** is that for the tea cards to show up correctly, here is an example of what your tea card should look like:

```html
<div id="tea-container" class="container">
   <div class="card">
     <h5>Tea Name</h5>
     <img src="...">
     <textarea>The tea's description goes here</textarea>
     <button>Save</button>
     <button>Remove</button>
   </div>
<div>

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
